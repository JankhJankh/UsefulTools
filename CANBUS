<Register>#<DATA BLOCK>
Data blocks change in size and format, registers are shared between some instruments like temp gauge and check engine light.
Things like speedo and RPMS have their own register.

Run log in verbose mode
canplayer -I candumptest.log -v

Send specific CANBUS data:
cansend can0 2A8#0A02BA02A4020002

Best strategy to go in blind. Format the log file into cansend requests, then sort them, this will order them by register, then send each register one at a time and stop when you hit the instrument you want.
Then analyse entropy in the requests to that register to find the right data sections to modify, hit em with a brute forcer.
